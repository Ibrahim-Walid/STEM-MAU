    body: `What are the origins of the Sudanese Civil war?
Imagine having a worthless piece of gold; you might ask, "How does gold become worthless?" Well, this is the sad case for the country of Sudan. Even before gaining independence in 1956, Sudan had faced several civil wars and coups. The first major civil war lasted from 1955 to 1976, mostly due to the internal divide between the wealthier northern region, with a majority of Muslim Arabs, and the undeveloped southern region, with a majority of Christians. The southern regions rebelled against the centralized government in Khartoum. Considered one of the longest African civil wars, the death toll for the first Sudanese civil war was estimated to be 500,000 to 1 million deaths. Thankfully, the Addis Ababa agreement granted autonomy for the south temporarily; however, it didn't last long, since renewed tensions sparked in 1983, which lasted until 2006. Similarly, conflicts rose up in response to imposing the Islamic Law (Sharia) nationwide. The Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M) was a key player in the conflict that fought for the south. The turning point in this war was signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, which ended the war by granting the south a 6-year autonomy period, after which the south will gain independence. Subsequently, in 2011, South Sudan was announced as an independent country, making it the 54th African independent state. Despite the secession of South Sudan, internal conflicts continued in Sudan. The Darfur region, known for its violence and mass displacement, has been the focal point since the 2000s. After the revolution in December 2018, overthrowing the longtime dictator Omar Al-Bashir, there was great hope for turning Sudan into a democratic, civilian-led country; unfortunately, this hope didn't last long. In October 2021, two of the biggest military coups formed a joint government to rule the country: the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by General Mohamed Hammadan—also known as Hamediti. The weak alliance between them started gradually breaking until shots were unleashed on the 15th of April 2023, marking the beginning of a third civil war.

The RSF
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Darfur region in Sudan, located in the western borders of Sudan, has had prolonged conflicts due to ethnic problems. 2003 marked the extreme rebelling of the Darfur region, which made the former president Omar Al-Bahir stop this rebel by force. That results in the Darfur war, which took away the lives of 300,000 and displaced 2.7 million people.
To destroy the uprising of non-Arabian tribes in the Nuba Mountains, located in South Sudan, Al-Bashir relied on a collection of Arab militias known as the Al-Janjaweed. In 2013, Al-Bashir announced that these militias would be known as the Rapid Support Force (RSF) and would be under the control of General Mohamed Hamdan, also known as Hamediti.
Al-Bashir relied on this force too often. In 2013, he sent them to fight against the rebels in Darfur and sent them to Libya and Yemen to fight. During this period, the RSF units developed relationships with the Russian private military Wagner Group. This secured thousands of weapons and personnel for them.

The Civil War
After tension between both sides, conflicts started growing rapidly, focusing on key locations. One of the most important locations is the capital, Khartoum. Khartoum instantly divided between the two forces, and Al-Burhan located his government in Port Sudan. At the beginning, the RSF managed to take control over the capital and the presidential palace; however, the SAF started slowly taking over control. It began by taking control over the center of Omdurman, one of the three cities that form Sudan's wide capital. In recent months, the army managed to recapture Al-Gezira and El-Fasher. Finally, as of May 2025, the SAF successfully took control over the majority of the capital and, most importantly, recaptured the presidential palace. After planning and occupying strategic locations on both the White and Blue Rivers, the SAF has imposed control on key locations. Outside the capital, the SAF managed to control the Red Sea shore, most of the North, the Ethiopian borders, and urban cities in Darfur.

How civilians are affected by the war
The civil war in Sudan has pretty huge costs, with over 150,000 deaths and over 14 million displacements. The RSF has besieged multiple urban cities and key institutions. The RSF has been accused of genocide and sexual violence. It was estimated as 30 cases of rape per day for women and girls as young as 15 years old in Khartoum, accompanied by severe beatings using sharp blades or gunfire. In addition to that, according to Action Against Hunger, over 35 million Sudanese people need food aid.

International involvements to stop war
After the war erupted, global attention was grabbed by the United Nations after the United Nations Human Rights Council called an immediate session to address the violence. On the 6th of May 2023, the RSF and the SAF's delegates met directly for the first time in Jeddah. After multiple negotiations, both delegates signed a treaty known as the Treaty of Jeddah on May 20 of the same year. It was signed by Saudi Arabia, the United States of America, and both Sudanese delegates. The treaty was made to ensure a long-term ceasefire between the two sides. The treaty stated the following:
• Agree that the interests and well-being of the Sudanese people are our top priority and to   ensure that civilians are protected at all times. 
•  Respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law; for instance, they obligate differentiation between civilians and military targets, not using civilians as human shields, and respecting public and private institutions.
• Commit to exert all efforts to ensure that these commitments—and all obligations of International Humanitarian Law—are fully disseminated within our ranks and appoint focal points to engage with humanitarian actors to facilitate their activities.
• Allow relevant actors, such as the Sudanese Red Crescent and/or the International Committee of the Red Cross, to take all steps needed to bury the dead in coordination with relevant authorities.
• Ensuring that all people operate under the instructions of the armed forces and the RSF abide by International Humanitarian Law.
• Prioritize talks to reach a short-term ceasefire to ease the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid and restore essential services, and commit to scheduling more expanded discussions to reach a permanent end to hostilities.
However, all these statements were broken only 48 hours after signing this treaty, after the RSF started shooting again in the capital of Khartoum`

    title: 'Rowanda and Democratic Republic of The Congo Issues',
    author: 'Fatma Hussain',

    body: `For decades, the lives of the Central Africans have been threatened by violence, instability, and conflict. Congo-Rwanda crisis is not merely a border war; it is actually a war that escalated when the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) accused the Rwandan government of supporting the notorious rebel group M23, which has been causing severe security and humanitarian problems throughout the entire eastern region of the DRC. Those accusations were rejected, and in response, Rwanda has blamed the DRC for sheltering the militias responsible for the 1994 genocide. As both countries trade blame, civilians continue to suffer, and the conflict is likely to continue.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide of the Tutsi, who are one of the major ethnic groups in the African Great Lakes region, primarily found in Rwanda and Burundi, was more than a regional humanitarian catastrophe, but the spark for a complex regional war whose consequences are continuing to be felt today. As Hutu — who are another major ethnic group in the African Great Lakes region, especially in Rwanda and Burundi — rebel troops fled over the border into eastern Congo to seek refuge and avoid accountability, the African Great Lakes region began to become drawn into the shadow of a recurring cycle of wars, rebellions, and retributive military interventions. East Congo was a rebel stronghold and theatre of regional power struggles, which spilled over into a series of wars alternatively referred to as the "African World War" due to the large number of states involved and the intricacy of the alliances that were formed and dissolved between them.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide of the Tutsi had a record wave of displacement, as hundreds of thousands of Hutus displaced themselves into neighboring states, mostly eastern Zaire (the Democratic Republic of the Congo). They were comprised of members of extremist militias directly responsible for the genocide, most notably the Interahamwe, a Hutu extremist militia responsible for much of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

The war resulted in the overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who rebel leader Laurent Désiré Kabila. This conflict, which also involved multiple neighboring countries, set the stage for the Second Congo War (1998–2003) due to tensions between Kabila and his former allies. The First and Second Congo Wars (1996–2003) laid the foundation for ongoing regional instability involving multiple African states and armed groups.

Although the Second Congo War officially ended in 2003, its deep-rooted causes and the ongoing involvement of regional powers—particularly Rwanda and Uganda—have kept the Kivu region mired in conflict, with continued instability and rebellion becoming a persistent reality. Conflict began in 2004 in the eastern Congo as an armed conflict between the military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and the Hutu Power group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It has broadly consisted of three phases, the third of which is an ongoing conflict. Prior to March 2009, the main combatant group against the FARDC was the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP). Following the cessation of hostilities between these two forces, rebel Tutsi forces, formerly under the command of Laurent Nkunda, became the dominant opposition to the government forces.

The United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) has played a large role in the conflict. With 21,000 soldiers in the force, the Kivu conflict constitutes the largest peacekeeping mission currently in operation. In total, 93 peacekeepers have died in the region, with 15 dying in a large-scale attack by the Allied Democratic Forces in North Kivu in December 2017. The peacekeeping force seeks to prevent the escalation of force in the conflict and minimize human rights abuses like sexual assault and the use of child soldiers in the conflict. CNDP was sympathetic to the Banyamulenge in Eastern Congo, an ethnic Tutsi group, and to the Tutsi-dominated government of neighboring Rwanda. It was opposed by the FDLR, the FARDC, and by United Nations forces, and a UN report in July 2024 revealed Rwanda's involvement in extensive military operations with the M23 rebels in eastern Congo, including the recruitment of child soldiers, human rights violations, and support for armed groups involved in violence and corruption.

The resurgence of the M23 rebellion since 2022 represents a turning point in the conflict, as limited clashes in Kivu province quickly turned into an open confrontation between Congo and Rwanda, leading to a regional escalation that threatens to lead to a full-scale war.

In 2022, a conflict erupted between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda after Rwandan forces infiltrated Congolese territory to support the M23 rebel movement. These forces participated in battles alongside the rebel movement against the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) and pro-government militias, further complicating the security situation and fueling tensions between the two sides.

Since the end of the Second Congolese War, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has been plagued by ongoing rebellions led by armed groups, most notably the M23 movement in North Kivu and its Tuirwaniho faction in the south, as well as the ADF group in Ituri and North Kivu. The conflict has escalated since March 2022 following a major offensive launched by the M23 movement, amid accusations from the Congo, the United Nations, and Western countries that Rwanda supports the movement and participates alongside it in the fighting, Rwanda and the M23 rebels accuse the Congolese government of collaborating with the FDLR, a group implicated in the Rwandan genocide. Despite denials from both sides, reports indicate that these mutual accusations are true, further complicating the regional conflict.

Burundi, which has accused Rwanda of orchestrating a 2015 coup attempt, deployed troops to assist the DRC against the M23 offensive. There were as many as 12,000 Burundian troops in eastern Congo until early February 2025, when the majority withdrew, leaving around 3,000. The MONUSCO peacekeeping mission has maintained that it is not involved in the conflict apart from its role in defending the region from militants, but has been accused by Rwanda of taking sides due to its cooperation with the Congolese armed forces. Meanwhile, the Congolese government has asked MONUSCO peacekeepers to leave the DRC due to a "failure to protect civilians from armed groups.

There were two efforts at peace negotiations organized between the DRC and Rwanda: one hosted by Kenya in 2022, which failed, and another hosted by Angola in 2024, the latter leading to a ceasefire agreement in August. Fighting between Congolese forces and Rwandan-backed M23 rebels resumed in October 2024 after having slowed down, and intensified towards the end of the year. Planned negotiations between Rwandan president Paul Kagame and Congolese president Félix Tshisekedi in December were cancelled over disagreements about preconditions. The Rwanda Defense Force had up to 4,000 troops in the DRC by a UN estimate in December 2024, and this increased to as much as 12,000 by March 2025.

During January 2025, the rebels carried out a successful offensive on Goma, the capital of the DRC's North Kivu province, displacing over 400,000 people and causing the DRC to cut off its diplomatic ties with Rwanda. The Congolese government called Rwandan military support for the rebels a "declaration of war." The fall of Goma after several days of fighting in late January has been the largest escalation of the Kivu conflict since M23 first occupied the city in 2012. M23 continued its advance into the rest of North Kivu and into South Kivu during February, capturing the latter's capital Bukavu. The African Union has called on M23 to withdraw to prevent the "balkanization" of the DR Congo, and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2773 that also called on Rwanda to end its support for M23.`

    title: 'South Sudan: A Human Tragedy',

    body: `Imagine waking up every day not knowing if you find food to eat, clean water to drink, or a safe place to sleep. For millions of people in South Soudan this is their reality. South Soudan, gained independence in 2011 with great hope, but that hope quickly faded as the country descended into violence and political struggles that left entire communities shattered. Million people depend on humanitarian aid just to stay alive. Hunger, violence, poverty, and illiteracy have become part of daily life for many families in South Soudan. Entire generations are being lost due to ongoing wars. This crisis is more than a political dispute; it is a human tragedy that continues to destroy lives. So we should know the real causes of the crisis, and why we should pay attention, not just for political reasons, but also for suffering people
The crisis in South Soudan is caused by several deep and rooted factors. One of the main causes is the conflict between political leaders, especially the dispute that occurred in 2013 between President Salva Kiir Mayardit, who belongs to the Dinka tribe, and his deputy Riek Macher, who is from the Nuer tribe. This led to a civil war that turned into a conflict between the Dinka and Nuer. Also, the weakness of government systems and political instability are important reasons that made it hard to keep order and protect national unity. In addition, the poor education and the spread of ignorance and illiteracy made it hard for people to know and ask for their rights, which made them less able to help build their society. All of these interconnected factors have led to violence, displacement, and suffering, which continue to affect millions of people across the country.
One of the saddest parts of the South Soudan crisis is the use of children in the war. Thousands of children, have been forced to fight, spy, or transport weapons. This is a serious violation of human rights, it takes away their childhood and education. It also causes them psychological trauma that is hard to treat. Despite the efforts made by international organizations to improve the situation, this is still happening in some areas. We should remember that there is a refugee crisis both inside and outside the country. Many people live in very hard conditions in camps that don’t have enough food, health care, or education. Because of this, thousands have escaped outside the country, looking for safety and a better life in nearby countries like Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. This crisis does not only hurt the lives of these people, but also puts pressure on the countries that host them, which are already facing economic problems.
Finally, the crisis in South Soudan is not only a political problem, but also a big human tragedy. Many people are suffering because of fighting between leaders, tribal problems, weak government, and poor education. Children are losing their future, families are broken, and people live in fear and poverty. We must care about the people of South Soudan and know what happens to them. The world needs to work together to bring peace, give support, and help the people live better lives again.`
