                            The STEM MAU Conference is the pinnacle of our season — a dynamic simulation that brings all the training, practice, and determination of our members together in one strong event. As a politically active team inspired by the African Union, our conference revolves around contemporary political, economic, and social matters in the African context. During the conference, the students act as formal delegates for African countries, formal debate, drafting resolutions, negotiating with blocs, and championing national interests — all within the realm of diplomacy and formal political dialogue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is not a mere show, but rather an actual demonstration of the skills developed throughout the course of a season. The sessions and committee work before the conference equip members with a repertoire of skills and competencies such as public speaking, policy analysis, research, negotiation, and strategic thinking. The conference provides a chance for practicing these skills as members get a first-hand feel of the dynamics of international decision-making, diplomacy, and leadership. Through this simulation, participants gain a greater understanding of African issues as they grow into articulate, confident individuals who can engage in meaningful discussions on current affairs.

                        <p>This article explored the political, economic, and social consequences of Sudan's 2011 secession, which resulted in the formation of two independent nations: Sudan and South Sudan. The discussion focused on the root causes of the division, the challenges of state-building, and the ongoing conflicts that followed. It was a central point of focus in our conference, where delegates analyzed the implications of the secession on regional stability and proposed diplomatic approaches to address unresolved tensions.</p>

                        <p>This paper examined Eritrea's decline of political freedoms and democratic government through themes like authoritarianism, suppression of civil liberties, and military conscription spanning decades. It provided an analytical summary of the internal issues that were prevailing over the Eritrean government and how they influenced regional affairs. Being one of our key themes throughout our conference, the article elicited serious debate among the delegates concerning the necessity of political reform, human rights, and foreign intervention to bring an end to the country's present political stagnation.</p>

                        <p>The topic touched on the vulnerabilities affecting Rwanda's internal and regional security, including border tensions, political oppression, and long-term legacy of violence. Delegates questioned how these factors undermine stability, when Rwanda's image has been one of post-genocide reconstruction and development. As one of our key areas of consideration in our conference, this topic allowed for detailed consideration of how to deepen lasting peace while practicing transparency, political accommodation, and regional cooperation.</p>

                        <p>With a spotlight on increasing crime rates, inequality, and civic unrest, this issue brought attention to the entrenched problems which are threats to public safety in South Africa. The delegates debated the root causes economic disparity, ineffective law enforcement, political instabilityو and how they are affecting citizens and foreign perceptions of the country. One of the main themes of our conference, it prompted debate around reforming policy, community protection strategies, and how government can recapture security and trust across the nation.</p>
